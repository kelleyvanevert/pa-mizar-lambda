   (i) Reconsidering                       (ii) "then" does not work
    variables apparently                    after an existential
    invalidates results                     elimination

    theorem                                 ex x st [ x ];
      [ x ]                                 then consider x such that [ x ];
    proof                                   then { x };
      reconsider x as ...;                     *4
      thus [ x ];
         *51 :: ?!                         ..although:
    end;
                                            [ x ];
                                            then { x };

    (iii) How to solve this?

     let M, p be [ M ];                (iv) Average number of open tabs
     func M|p -> ...                    in sublimetext? ~ 20

     ex p st
       M|p = N|p
       ***                         (v) Waiting for Mizar to compile
                                    -->  proof thus [ correctness thesis ]; end;
    ..the workaround:               so you know you've got the correctness
                                    thesis right in the first place.
     ex p,q st p = q &
       M|p = N|q

                                               (vii) How many ways to say that proof material
                                                is missing?
  (vi) Writing build scripts with                             *1       *60
   lots of perl regexing so you don't                            *4          ...more?
   have to keep forgetting to list your                     *70
   names in the .voc file.


                                     (ix) Remembering error counts to get a feel
                                      of "how happy" Mizar is.
